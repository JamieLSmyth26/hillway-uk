Explain the codebase or specific part: $ARGUMENTS

If $ARGUMENTS is empty, give a high-level overview:
1. Project structure and architecture
2. Key technologies and frameworks
3. Main entry points
4. How different parts connect

If $ARGUMENTS specifies a file or feature:
1. What it does and why it exists
2. How it works (step by step)
3. Key dependencies and relationships
4. Any gotchas or non-obvious behavior

Use diagrams (mermaid or ASCII) if it helps explain structure.
