Load project context and get ready to work.

1. Read the project's README.md and any CLAUDE.md files
2. Identify the tech stack from package.json, pyproject.toml, etc.
3. Understand the project structure (key directories, entry points)
4. Check for any .env.example to understand required config
5. Look at recent git commits to understand current work

Summarize:
- **Project**: What this project does
- **Stack**: Technologies used
- **Structure**: Key directories and their purpose
- **Entry points**: Where things start
- **Current state**: Recent activity and any WIP

Then say "Ready to help with [project name]. What would you like to work on?"
