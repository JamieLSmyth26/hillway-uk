## Active Cases

### Peter Kelk v Jock Sergison's Garage Ltd (Small Claims)
- **Status:** Letter Before Action received 30 Jan 2026. Deadline to respond: 13 Feb 2026.
- **Claim:** £1,964.90 (£824 repairs + £1,011 vehicle loss + £120 conciliation + £9.90 travel)
- **Key docs:** `~/Desktop/Peter Kelk v Jocks Garage - Case Review and Strategy.docx` (full analysis)
- **Draft letter:** `~/Dropbox/08 Jock Sergison Garage Ltd/.../Jocks Garage Documents/DRAFT - Without Prejudice Response to Letter Before Action.md`
- **Recommended settlement:** £700 (without prejudice save as to costs)
- **Previous offer:** ~50% (~£412) via CEDR conciliation — rejected
- **URGENT actions pending:**
  1. Notify business liability insurer (not yet done)
  2. D R Autocare independent review (requested, pending)
  3. Confirm with David Wilson (conciliator) if 50% offer was formally documented
  4. Get Shane's detailed statement on diagnostic reasoning
- **Key vulnerabilities:** Factual error in chargeback response re timing of return visit; no combustion gas test performed (garage doesn't have equipment); WhatsApp video ignored; £55 charge for ongoing issue
- **Key strengths:** Work addressed genuine faults; D R Autocare initially supported rocker cover diagnosis; no independent written evidence of head gasket failure; vehicle scrapped destroying evidence
- **Messaging note:** Lead with Shane's professional judgment, not equipment gap. Don't overstate thread damage as full explanation (symptoms continued after tank replacement).
